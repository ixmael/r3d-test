# R3D technical test
This resolves the [technical test for R3D](https://gaudy-glider-f2e.notion.site/Prueba-Software-Engineer-en-R3D-5b6268142312403da794e012304e6bf5) for the backend position.

## Organization
This project intends to follow the sections on the test. I implemented the levels in differents directory.
- The level 1 (function to count sequences in a string) is implemented in the dir *packages/core*.
- The level 2 (a minimal RestAPI to count sequences in a string) is implemented in the dir *packages/restapi*.
- The level 3 (a RestAPI to count sequences in a string and show the stats) is implemented in the dir *packages/restapil3*.
- Level 4
The level 4 (a frontend to consume the level 3 RestAPI) is implemented in the dir *packages/frontend*.
